**Explanation of Choices and Assumptions:**
"*   **Bank Name:** I've consistently used "Altamaha Bancshares" and "Altamaha Bank & Trust Co."  based on how the information was presented in the document for Securities holders and Insiders","respectively."
*   **Locations (Town):** Extracted the town from the address of the shareholder/insider.
*   **Dates:**  I've set the 'Fiscal Year' to 2016 as specified in the FR Y-6 document title.
*   **Percentages:**  Extracted the percentage as shown in the document.
"*   **Affiliations:**  Used the company names provided in column (3)(c) of the FR Y-6","under the column titled with other businesses","as the "Affiliation" in the insider table."
*   **Occupations:** Extracted based on what was stated under column (2).
"*   **RSSD_ID:** RSSD_ID not available for the Individuals (Securities Holder table); thus","I left those blank in the `Securities Holders CSV`. Since","the FR Y-6 data is for "Altamaha Bancshares","Inc."","I used "1081510" for those rows of `INSIDERS CSV`."
"I made best-effort assumptions to complete the table rows that you asked for. Please let me know if you have any more specific requests","or further questions that I can answer."
