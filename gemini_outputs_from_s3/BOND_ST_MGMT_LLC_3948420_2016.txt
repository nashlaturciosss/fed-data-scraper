"NOTE:  I had to make some assumptions as there was no indication for some column values. For example","the RSSD_ID and Occupation for some of the Insiders were blank. I entered "N/A" for those empty cells.  Please adjust accordingly if you have the proper values. Also","no RSSD_ID or City/Town was listed for the listed "Bank" entries in the first table. I have added these where possible based on other entries within the report","and have left the remaining columns blank."
